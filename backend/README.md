## How to get started

I highly recommend installing virtualenv and having a virtual environment, then
go through the following steps

Ensure you have python 3 and then run:
```bash
make init
```

Then to start the app run:
```bash
make start
```

## Good to know

If you add a dependency then run:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

If you want to recompile the documentation then go to docs/ directory and run:
```bash
make html
```
